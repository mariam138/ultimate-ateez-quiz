## Introduction

A fun quiz game made to test your knowledge on the Kpop group called Ateez. Find out how well you know them!

## Design
### Colour Scheme

For the colour scheme, I chose to use colours `#5BCCED` (bright blue) and `#FAD732` (bright yellow). These colours were chosen as they are bright and fun colours, but are also the colour theme of one of Ateez's album covers.

These colours were checked for accessibility using [EightShapes](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/).

The two colours passed with AAA on a black background and vice versa, so I decided to use those colours overall for my colour scheme, keeping the blue and yellow for highlights.

### Typography

For the main title, I wanted a fun font that was similar to handwriting, but still readable for accessibility. For this, I chose the **"Averia Sans Libre"** font. To find a font to match it, I used [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/).

Fontjoy generated the font **"Nunito Sans"** which I have decided to use as my paragraph and question text for my quiz.

### Wireframes

To produce wireframes for the quiz, I used Balsamiq. The wireframes helped me have a basic idea of the setup I wanted for my quiz, although the aim was to keep it all on one page. I made wireframes for both mobile and desktop for the home page, the quiz itself and the score page at the end.

## Features

### Home Page

The home page features a group picture of ateez as the background with a bright blue plain background which fits in with the colour scheme. Underneath the title quiz is another group picture of Ateez, which is responsive. Underneath the picture is the tagline **"How well do you know Ateez?"**, followed by some more paragraph text. Underneath the text there are three buttons: one to start the quiz, one for the instructions on how the quiz works and lastly one to change the settings of the game.

On larger screens, hovering the mouse over the buttons will change their colour with a slight transition. The blue **"Start!"** button will change into a lighter blue, while the **"Instructions"** and **"Settings"** buttons change their background colour to black and the text to yellow. This is to indicate clickability, but also to separate the **"Start!"** button from the others visually, to indicate it has a different action.

## Deployment

Deployment of the project took place early on, once the HTML and CSS for the home page had been set up. Deployment took place as follows:

1. The GitHub page for the website was loaded
2. The **Settings** tab was clicked, located in the top right corner.
3. From the **Settings** page, on the left-hand side the **Pages** tab was clicked from the menu.
4. Under the **Branch** section, the page was selected to be made from the **main** branch followed by the **root** folder.
5. These settings were saved and the website was deployed after a few minutes, with a link being provided at the top of the page.
