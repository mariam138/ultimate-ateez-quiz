## Introduction

A fun quiz game made to test your knowledge on the Kpop group called Ateez. Find out how well you know them!

## User Experience
### User Stories

## Design
### Colour Scheme

For the colour scheme, I chose to use colours `#5BCCED` (bright blue) and `#FAD732` (bright yellow). These colours were chosen as they are bright and fun colours, but are also the colour theme of one of Ateez's album covers.
