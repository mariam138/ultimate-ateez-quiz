## Introduction

A fun quiz game made to test your knowledge on the Kpop group called Ateez. Find out how well you know them!

### Colour Scheme

For the colour scheme, I chose to use colours `#5BCCED` (bright blue) and `#FAD732` (bright yellow). These colours were chosen as they are bright and fun colours, but are also the colour theme of one of Ateez's album covers.

These colours were checked for accessibility using [EightShapes](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/).

The two colours passed with AAA on a black background and vice versa, so I decided to use those colours overall for my colour scheme, keeping the blue and yellow for highlights.

### Typography

For the main title, I wanted a fun font that was similar to handwriting, but still readable for accessibility. For this, I chose the **"Averia Sans Libre"** font. To find a font to match it, I used [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/).

Fontjoy generated the font **"Nunito Sans"** which I have decided to use as my paragraph and question text for my quiz.

### Wireframes

To produce wireframes for the quiz, I used Balsamiq. The wireframes helped me have a basic idea of the setup I wanted for my quiz, although the aim was to keep it all on one page. I made wireframes for both mobile and desktop for the home page, the quiz itself and the score page at the end.
